This repository contains all manufacturing and documentation files related to
the Vitro Shard Edge carrier board project.

## Shard Edge

Vitro Shard Edge is a carrier board equipped with multiple industry interfaces
(e.g. RS232, RS485, ADC, Current Loop, CAN) and low-level embedded interfaces
(e.g. GPIO, UART, SPI, I2C) with an mPCIe slot designed for Vitro Shard. Vitro
Shard Edge extends the operation of Vitro Shard device and easily provides
multiple interfaces to the user allowing to attach sensors and communication
channels to Vitro Shard.
